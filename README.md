  ## Description
   This is a Node.js command-line application designed to allow the user to build their team roster of employees with info cards for the manager, engineers and interns. Each employee card will display contact info such as the employee's name, position, email, and employee ID. This app was designed with Test Driven Development in mind. When the user has completed building their team, the app will create an HTML file in the distribution folder that will display  a cleanly formatted roster based upon the user's input.
